Influence of Macroeconomics Indicators on Stock within Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA)

1. Statement of Research Question: How does the Five Key Macroeconomics Indicators affect the stocks within the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA). [5 Key Macroeconomics Indicators: CPI (Inflation), GDP Growth, Unemployment Rate, Federal Funds Rate, Oil Prices]

2. Project Background & Data Suitability: Objective is analyzing the relationship between 5 macroeconomics factors and 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA). The Dataset consists of the five key macroeconomics indicators (from Federal Reserve Economics Data FRED). The Stock market data starting from January 1980 to January 2025

      • 5 Main industries in the DJIA:

          o	Technology & Communication Services: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO), IBM, Intel (INTC), Verizon (VZ)

          o	Financials & Insurance: JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), American Express (AXP), Travelers (TRV), Visa (V), UnitedHealth Group (UNH)

          o	Industrials & Energy: Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Honeywell (HON), 3M (MMM), Chevron (CVX), ExxonMobil (XOM)

          o	Consumer Discretionary & Staples: Home Depot (HD), McDonald’s (MCD), Nike (NKE), Disney (DIS), Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG)

          o	Healthcare & Miscellaneous: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Amgen (AMGN), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Walmart (WMT), RTX Corporation (RTX)

3. Methodologies: [Statistical Methods: Multiple Linear Regression with ANOVA; ARIMA Time Series Forecasting] + [Exploratory Methods: Correlation Heat Maps; Clustering (1. Hierarchical Clustering; 2. K-Means; 3. Model Based Clustering); Event Driven Analysis]

5. Overall Results: Our findings show that industry reactions to macro shifts depend heavily on the broader economic context. Rate cuts, for example, can either trigger recoveries or signal deeper problems. Financials and Industrials are highly cyclical, Healthcare and Consumer Staples offer defensive stability, and Technology tends to be more insulated from traditional macro trends. We believe our analysis is a strong starting point to show the value of integrating macroeconomic analysis into investment decisions. These insights, often overlooked when macro and equity research are separated, can become much more powerful when combined. Responding thoughtfully to the broader economic environment, rather than just to policy moves, can significantly strengthen both returns and risk management.
