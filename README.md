Methodologies:
•	Statistical Methods: 
o	Multiple Linear Regression with ANOVA
o	ARIMA Time Series Forecasting
•	Exploratory Methods: 
o	Correlation Heat Maps
o	Clustering (1. Hierarchical Cludtering; 2. K-Means; 3. Model Based Clustering)
o	Event Driven Analysis
Overall Results:
Our findings show that industry reactions to macro shifts depend heavily on the broader economic context. Rate cuts, for example, can either trigger recoveries or signal deeper problems. Financials and Industrials are highly cyclical, Healthcare and Consumer Staples offer defensive stability, and Technology tends to be more insulated from traditional macro trends. 

We believe our analysis is a strong starting point to show the value of integrating macroeconomic analysis into investment decisions. These insights, often overlooked when macro and equity research are separated, can become much more powerful when combined. Responding thoughtfully to the broader economic environment, rather than just to policy moves, can significantly strengthen both returns and risk management.
